    <h1>10 ways to make your HTML-CSS code accessible</h1>
    <p>Web accessibilty is the most talked topic these days. But do you know why accessibilty is important.

        <li>Add a 'main' tag for inputting the most specific content of the page. ALso, there is only one main tag per page.</li>
        <li>Add alternative text to all images on the webpage: This mainly helps incase the image is broken or when screen readers are used for reading the page.</li>
        <li>Wrap your content in 'article' tag when you are writing independant content like news , blogs , etc.</li>
        <li>Contect inside the article element can be grouped inside the section elements. This ways thematically related contect can be put together as sections.</li>
        <li>The figure element can be used to wrap visual content like images,diagrams or charts in a semantic way.</li>
        <li>A particular input element can be put inside its respective label element to provide it a specific form control. </li>
        <li>Links can be made more navigable by adding the accesskey attribute within the links, button, form control elements.</li>
        <li>Use various color combinations and contrasts to provide better readability.</li>
